# ProgressBar-Java

Overview:
I followed along a YouTube video to make a simple progress bar. 
To make the progress bar, it consist with a JFrame, JProgressBar, while loop, 
and a try-catch block. 
The bar will start at zero but it will progress until it reaches to a hundred.
Once its reaches to the end, it will display done.
